# Healthcare-Portal-Frontend
The aim of this project is to create a patient-doctor portal so that we can improve the diagnostic process by reducing the patient’s commute time, reduce the payment required for treatment and help in creating a self-diagnostic system to make use of the doctor’s time more efficiently.
