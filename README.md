# Healthcare-Portal-Frontend
The aim of this project is to create a patient-doctor portal so that we can improve the diagnostic process by reducing the patient’s commute time, reduce the payment required for treatment and help in creating a self-diagnostic system to make use of the doctor’s time more efficiently.

## Cause of developin this portal

Focusing on quality health care services means ensuring patient health management at
a superior level at all times. However, federal rules and regulations are making
processes even more tedious and lengthy. Due to this, keeping such processes intact
and still providing effective patient care is not feasible in many cases. The major issue
in providing quality healthcare services is the gap between providers and payers. The
dependency of middlemen in the supply chain makes it even worse.

In the healthcare sector, critical patient data and information remains scattered across
different departments and systems. Due to this, crucial data is not accessible and
handily available in times of need. The existing healthcare ecosystem cannot be
considered complete as multiple players in the system do not have a system in place
for smooth process management. Moreover, it is also termed as inadequate for
handling the exchange of information and requires certain major changes.

Block chain is one of the most disruptive technologies that have taken the world by
storm these days. A block chain is nothing but a distributed ledger that keeps track of
transactions and activities happening throughout the network. The most unique factor
of a block chain is that once a piece of information is added to the distributed ledger,
no one can alter it. The information stored on a block chain is absolutely secure in its
entirety. In order for anyone to make a change in one block, it is mandatory to make
changes to all the subsequent blocks after it.
