On logging on to the application, the patients will have the option of signing in or
signing up based on whether they are returning users or new users respectively. The
login is based on a face recognition system, that will record their face at the time of
sign up and store it in the database along with their personal details. The login page
will take their picture so as to verify their identity by face and also can be used by
the doctor for any new visual symptoms.
